Looks good -- applied! Congrats on the first patch :-) Contributing to open
source projects is a lot of fun, hope you'll like it!

OK, a couple of nitpicks then:

For some reason the first line of the patch contains mysterious '>' at the
start, and because of this can't be automatically applied. I usually use "git
format-patch -1" to generate patch from the latest commit, and the resulting
files always look good.  

> Subject: [PATCH] Added example for %25{bitrate} format string.  

"doc: add example for %25{bitrate} format string" would be a tiny bit better
IMHO.

https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/Writing-good-commit-messages is a nice
summary of how to create decent commit messages.

> +in the example below.   

There was a trailing space in this line; I've removed it. When reviewing
changes with "git diff" or "git log -p", git can highlight trailing whitespace;
I think it even does that by default.

!!Getting new roles into the projects

titanpad

We know programmers and -- for the most lucky projects around -- designers and XP specialists.

But, what about:
* Project managers (most of all to manage external contributors)
* Journalists
* Technical writers
* Translators (not for GUI!)
!!Technical tools

Most projects have a wiki and a bug tracker. What can help getting and keeping contributors?
* using distributed revision control systems to better manage patches and branches (but harder to learn for non-programmers)
* allow task specific branches

don't talk about it...

GSOC: pupils should fix one big and one small bug (unrelated to their project) during each GSOC period (and one small before getting accepted as a pupil)
!!Discussion with BartK

[@
14:25 %3c a_l_e_> the panel will be 90 minutes...
14:25  * BartK nods
14:27 %3c a_l_e_> and we will probably be 4 people on stage (me and 2 other people who already have agreed to 
                be part of it)
14:28  * BartK nods.
14:28 %3c BartK> Well, I'd love to take part. :)
14:28 %3c a_l_e_> i'd like to have some sort of list of topics... the best thing would be to have 1 or 2 short 
                talks (about 10 minutes) at the beginning, then start the discussion...
14:29 %3c a_l_e_> ... and and have 2 other short presentations (again about 10 minutes each) when changing the 
                topic in the panel.
14:30 %3c a_l_e_> (i did already count you among the 2 people who did agree :-)
14:31 %3c BartK> ah, very cool.
14:31 %3c BartK> so I should plan on 10 minutes or so?
14:31 %3c a_l_e_> tomrorrow i will travel to montreal, and on thurday i will certainly take the time to go 
                through the details.
14:31 %3c BartK> ok
14:32 %3c a_l_e_> it could also be 15 or 5 minues... it depends on how much you have to say... but i'd like to 
                keep an avarage of 10 minutes per talk...
14:32 %3c BartK> Shouldn't be a problem.  I'll put something together and give you the time.
14:32 %3c a_l_e_> as soon as all three guys have agreed to join the panel, i will send you (plural) an email 
                with the list of the others who are in there.
14:32 %3c BartK> cools
14:33 %3c a_l_e_> i hope i can do it this evening CET
14:33 %3c a_l_e_> voilà... and now: back to work :-)
