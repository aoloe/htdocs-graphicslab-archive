!!!Planning

* do it as a draft for the Libre Graphics Magazine?
* 1000 copies, a5, 24 pages on bio-set cost 750 euros incl vat
* and there will probably be an edition Code:Free for the lgm: if christian is fast enough (and if he doesn't plan to print it) we could take parts of it and make some publicity for the online version of code:free.
* ginger has done some nice things
* osp can see what we can use from interviews around
* prokoudines writing about lgm ... maybe he would want to adapt it for this?
* personally, i think we should concentrate on text which have already been written but not yet printed + some original works...
* i think that i'd like to do a more precise plan about the magazine before the end of april.
* rlafuente: any identity guidelines that we should follow? or are we free to go for an awesome layout proposal? :o)  ---> (free imho)
* let's gather ideas on a wiki page and take it from there. we should work on this in week 10-14 may
* design is up to us/ricardo + Ana (well ... free fonts, free software)
* printer is 3 day printing time

* book on new zealand

!!My todos

* ask louis or cedric about eyrolles
* http://www.bomots.de/ or http://www.dpunkt.de/ or http://www.addison-wesley.de for german books?
* find out whether the pledge is worth the hassle (energy we put in it / how many external people give how much money)
!! Make sure that the following things happens

* reserving some physical space for Wang Lingzheng and her book project
* Wang Lingzheng gets an invitation
* getting helen varley jamieson to present UpStage
* seeing if Ilmari Heikkinen should be at lgm (ff plugin for wacom tablets)
* zgrirg (http://www.ong-adg.be/spip/ADG-News,51.html) should show his newsletters at lgm
* see who Kasper Souren could host
* Inga Kaupelyte and other curious graphic designer: how can we welcome them?


!Anzeigentafel

after having read this request from jon, i thought that it may be nice
to prepare a wall @ lgm where the devs could physically hang such
requests...

i'm thinking more of an ordered grid (simply marked with some tape?)
where everyone could put his A5/A4 piece of paper...

i could even think about putting online something similar...

-> i will work on it the days i'm in bruxelles...

!Meeting place

* A place with rectangular tables, with (white?) paper tablecloths where the people is welcome to write their notes / messages
* when the paper is full it gets replaced with a fresh one
* every evening the tables get photographed and the image archived, put in the web and analyzed
* every morning there is a short report over the content of the tablecloths.

Todo:
* Is it easy to find the paper tablecloths in Bruxelles?
* Are there some rectangular tables?
* Who does the report?
* how to store them?
** just hang them somewhere?
** a poster display? (something like http://www.edimeta.com/pos-equipment/newspaper-stand/poster-stand/poster-display.html)

We may offer some (visible) place for "spontaneous" lightning talks over lunch:
* 1 table, 1 flip chart 1 beamer, 20 chairs
