!Accordeon to tabs with icons

* Pierre knows how to change the code (he should already have a patch for it) and it's a simple job.
* Choosing the icons (Claudia and Jake?)

!! Drawing the icons

Ale, Cedric and Vlada have drawn 8 icons in a collective effort. You can see (and eventually edit) them here:

Please put below your comments on the icons.

Notes of the authors:
* We will try to have icons which are as desaturated as possible.
* The icons may change in the future as we get to refactor the content of the PP.

somme comments:

* X,Y,Z (new name?)
** we want to avoid the idea of the coordinates
**[Louis] XYZ is the precisefulness tab of Scribus... It’s the basic positions of elements. The icons proposed are not explicit enough but I realy have not much to say to help further here.
* Shape
* Group
* Text
* Image
** [Louis] I would prefer to see something "real" and in color, or at least in color!
* Line
** [Louis] The Inkscape version is strong. I much prefer the arrow than in the Sribus version. I agree that the line thickness in Inkscape is a bit a distraction.
* Colors
** [Louis] The color tab must show colors in my view. I like the register mark and to solve the issue here I would simply remove the grey and black quarter circles by CMKY quarter circles.
* Transparency
**[Louis] What about 2 colored circles overlapping and showing a third color? The circle and the square are too close to the shape tab. The absence of color is mindboggling a bit in my view.

!! Changes to the PP
* move the style selector to the top of each tab
* char styles only shown when a text is selected; otherwise only show paragraph styles
* mark with bold the differences against the base style
* the reset to "parent" marker should be part of each widget (a widget may have several reset markers; see an example in qt-designer; it may be interesting to pop up a context menu when clicking on the marker)

other topics:
* add a last line offset (analogous to the first line offset)

!! QuickAccess

* enter drucken = zu machen
* ok button = zu machen
!! Next steps

* Get internal feedback
* Draw the final drafts in Inkscape and post them on the SVN server
* Get external feedback:
** Jakub ([[http://tango.freedesktop.org/ArtLibreSet|Tango-compatible]])
** Pierre (who will probably integrate them in the Scribus code)
* Post the icons in the bug tracker

!The philosophy of the PP

!! Which information is managed in the PP?

!! Focusing on the styles

!! How to display the information?

!Use cases for a modular Properties Palette

!!Repetitive access to some PP elements

I'd like to explain how one could use a stack of PP widgets... tbc.

!!Dynamically adding elements to the PP

* Scripts (loaded at startup?)
* Plugins

!Prototyping the new PP

%25width:300px%25 Attach:pp_single_panel_20101110.png

* move the levels to a "layers and levels" palette
* fast changing of the shape is something which normally not needed and will be offered in the edit dialog of the shape
* The line information related to the border are integrated in the border section (the rest go to the content palette for the beziers and lines: is there a need for lines and beziers?)
* for the colors, only the basic inoformation is shown in the PP. the rest gets shown when you click on the bordre / background or transparency button.
* What is shown in the color section depends on the type of color (solid gradient or pattern). the border has 2 more lines related to the line.
* Should the style be for the whole PP or should there be a flow style, a border style, a background style, ...)?
* The details on the color (cmyk vs rgb, code) is shown when hovering on it.
* There should be a way to hide the colors which are not been "actively" used (they may be part of an imported svg, but you will never assign them to any frame).
