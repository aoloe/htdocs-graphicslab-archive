(:title Sketching:)
(:#toc:)

it would be nice to separate the sketching from the task of drawing a real dialog

* we will try to draw the sketches with [[http://pencil.evolus.vn/|pencil]]
* we will use the svn repository to store all the sketches in the original format
* we will upload png of the sketches to the wiki, adding the name / path to the orignal sketch

* we will draw the real dialogs in qt designer
* we will also share the *.ui files through the google svn repository
