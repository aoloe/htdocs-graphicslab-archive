! Links and anchors

if you want to create an "anchor" just type

[@
[[#bug_esc_key_too_overloaded]]
@]

at the place your want to reference (where the label must start with a letter and it can't contain any spaces) and use it then in the place you want to reference from:

[@
see the [[ThatPage#bug_esc_key_too_overloaded|bug]] i already described
@]

or, if you're on the same page:

[@
see the [[#bug_esc_key_too_overloaded|bug]] i already described
@]

it's a bit clumsy and i wouldn't use it too much.

! Images and attachments

* [@Attach:image_name.png@] lets you upload an image and shows it in the page.
* [@[[(Attach:)lg_flyer_de.pdf]]@] lets you upload a file and shows the link to it.
* [@(:attachlist:)@] to manage the uploads
