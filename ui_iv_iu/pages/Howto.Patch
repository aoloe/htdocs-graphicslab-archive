!apply a patch

[@patch -p1 %3c thepatch.patch@]

the @@-l@@ parameter may be needed if there is a white space mismatch

!create a patch

To create a patch for a single file, use the form:\\
[@diff -u original.c new.c > original.patch@]

To create a patch for an entire source tree, make a copy of the tree:\\
[@cp -R original new@]

You can also use SVN's own diff to create the patch without having the original file on your disk:

[@svn diff path/to/dir --diff-cmd /usr/bin/diff -x "-i -b" > mypatch@]

or even

[@svn diff path/to/dir  > mypatch@]
