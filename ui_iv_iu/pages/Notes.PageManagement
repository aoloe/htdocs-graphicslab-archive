Join all the page managing dialogs in one window.

mean :
* Manage Pages
* Manage Master Pages
* Insert several Pages
* Apply Master Pages

Questions :
* should it manage the layers, too?
     - not sure layers are related to page (more content management)
* add context menu support on pages
* use button/action icons in the windows (somewhat in Adobe style !)
