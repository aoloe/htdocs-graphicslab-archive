# Create an editorial review system

Once the document has been layouted, it goes through several steps of review. How can help this  steps to be as smooth as possible?
- Typos & spell checking

It really depends on the editorial habits of each team.

Some proofreaders cannot work on screen, writing notes for corrections. Some
can. Some use a tablet and write on the file like they would on paper. Some
use the notes capabilities of Acrobat in PDFs. Then, to actually enter those
corrections into the layout, having a file instead of a paper aside of the
screen makes people dream of a second monitor so they could display both the
proofs and the job... There is no real easy answer.

So... a system that would allow to stick notes on or around the page would
certainly be usefull to people but should this be at PDF level only and not
at Scribus level is a question that remains to be answered !

Intuitively I would be encline to think that frame and character level is
too close to the structure of the Scribus document and could appeal to some
people but would maybe not be as useful as we can think. However the
document, section and page levels seems to be a bit more flexible and would
probably be a nice addition.

We have to think of this with a few case scenario in mind. Who writes the
notes ? Who reads them ? What are the next steps once the note is read ? If
we could integer in Scribus an easy way to put correction signs on the page
(on a distinct layer probably) that could be put using the mouse or a pen
and a tablet, this would be great I think.

I would need to ask a few proofreaders here and get back to you with the
result of this discussion ! :-)

Being able to further tag those pages would be a real benefit. The tags themselves would be let to users.* (Only as an example, pages could be tagged for approval — by one or more people — , for quality control, for color space tied to the imposition (some pages will we in cmyk and some in black ink only and at some point this info becomes critical as the work evolves because the imposition pattern does not follow the read pattern). Basically, what we need is only to be able to tag the page. What's in the tag is up to the user. We can determine how many tags will be allowed. 5-6 tags would be enough in my view but this is completely up to various needs and the complexity of the work. Some documents require more levels of approval than others.
