# Scribus in a Business Environment

ale / 2012-10-01 11:33:31

While Scribus has mostly been created with the graphic designer workflow in mind, we notice that it's also often used for "Business" task, like creating dynamic forms or catalogs.

The question we will try to answer is: what are the needs of business people on Scribus?

This morning i got this spam mail:

"We all need to create professional looking PDF documents and forms for tasks such as implementing workgroup collaboration, producing company collateral, finalizing agreements, applying digital signatures, and document archiving. A complete PDF solution for enterprises and governmental organizations should consist of a wide variety of economical solutions for enterprise PDF management, including creation, collaboration, editing, securing, reading, and rights protection. This white paper focuses on an enterprise-class solution to create, collaborate, edit, and secure PDF documents."

While, i would never want to buy anything from them -- and didn't even bother to click the link -- I find the above sentence  a good summary of a whole class of feature requests to Scribus. And i'm more and more unsure if we should support that type of usage.

One important step, could be to make sure that the free pdf readers and scribus can support all the needed features... (like saving the form fields values for the forms created by Scribus)

Here a post taken from the scribus mailing list:

I am currently conducting a series of tests with SCRBUS to create PDF 
documents and forms.
These documents contain exercises for courses in electrical and 
electronic, the statements are not fixed, javascript calculate the 
values , choose inside a lists of words.
All of this is to provide students with a different exercise each time 
he open the file .

My question is:
Is it possible to automate the loading of text files containing the 
necessary javascript libraries via a python script into a scribus document?

What methods and properties should be used?

Thank you in advance
Yours

Mr. XXXX
