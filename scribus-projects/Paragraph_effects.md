# Paragraph effects

ale / 2012-10-10 11:25:39

Already in Scribus:
- drop caps

Currently being implemented:
- bulleted lists with a choice among several types of bullets
- numeration of lists
- numeration of headings

Further wishes
- paragraph as a box:
  - lines above, below, left and right of a paragraph
    - thickness
    - color + shade
    - type
    (we could force the user to use line styles for thickness, colors, shade and type; with a + button to add a new style)
    - padding (the reference is the baseline)
    - length (left and right / top and bottom indents)
  - background color
    - color + shade
    - padding
  - option to apply the effect line wise
  (it would be nice to have the same effects available also for single words or a text selection)
   (all of those effects are drawn below the content)
