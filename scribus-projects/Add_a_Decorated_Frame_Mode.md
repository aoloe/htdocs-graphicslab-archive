# Add a "Decorated Frame" Mode

While the a very "decent" decoration around the frames is something very valuable, there are times when the user would wish to have all the pertinent commands drawn around the frame.

One example of successful "modal" behavior is Inkscape switch between shape resizing and shape rotation.
In Scribus this duality is not as interesting as in vector drawing and we will probably need to switch between a "decent" decoration like we currently have and one which brings a higher number of commands at your fingertips.

Candidates to be shown on the frame are:
- Rotating
- Horizontal / vertical autoresizing
- Lock frame
- Cut the overflow in text frames
- Link / unlink text frames (and break the link with cut)
- Resize the image to the frame or the image frame to its content
