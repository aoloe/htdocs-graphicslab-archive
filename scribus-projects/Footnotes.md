Define all what is needed for a perfect footnotes support in Scribus.

- Placement of the footnotes text frame should be optionally managed through a frame style (fixed position on the page)
- Optionally manage one single footnotes area per page
- Welding should not be enabled by default (or should it be a preference?)
- One char style for the footnote in the text and one for the footnote in the notes area (instead of the subscript checkbox)

Details:
- Clicking on a label should switch the checkbox
