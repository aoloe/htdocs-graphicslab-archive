# Improve the linking and unlinking of text frames

- There should be an active area at the top left and bottom right (already exists: the overflow mark) where action on the links can be triggered.
- It should be possible to break a link without having to scroll around and find the next text frame in the chain.


Some more topics to be discussed:

One open question is if the information about which page the previous / next text frame is on is really interesting or we should simply have a way to "jump" to the next / previous linked frame.
