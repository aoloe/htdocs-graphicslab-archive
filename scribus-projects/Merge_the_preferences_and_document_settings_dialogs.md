# Merge the preferences and document settings dialogs

For most people, the distinction between preferences and document settings is hard to grasp.

We should simplify the document settings (move several of the settings to style definition) and let the user change the defaults for the application and the values for the current document in the same dialog (eventually letting even change the values for all open documents).

One example for such a behavior can be found in Qt Creator.
