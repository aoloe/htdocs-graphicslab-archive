# Create a log palette

We could need a "log" palette where Scribus could write information that may be interesting for the user or may help him sort out problems.
- If activated, the log will be filled in any case, whether the palette is displayed or not.
- When a problem arises (ex.: bad print in landscape) the user can have a look at the log and look for (ex: if the print is not correct, try to use the PDF export, instead)
- There should be a search mechanism
- Database based (sqlite?)
- Old entries can automatically be deleted
- Automatically discard (too verbose?) entries matching a pattern
