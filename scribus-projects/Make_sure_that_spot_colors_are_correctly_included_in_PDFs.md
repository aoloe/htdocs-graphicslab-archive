- use the spot colors defined in tiff images
- use the spot color for grayscale images with a color filter using spot colors

We used your workaround script. Alex modified it to have only one color and 
not 2. It works fine (thanks!), and in Scribus Print Preview, there is 
no CMYK. Perfect. But when we check on Acrobat Pro on MACOS (or sending 
to the printer), all bitmap images are back to CMYK...
Deadline is quite soon and we would like to avoid making one PDF per 
color because it's quite a complicated object already...

Pierre Huyghebaert told me we could import a tiff that we colorize 
directly in Scribus to have the proper color? He says it's not the 
"colorize" option in the Effects. But he can't remember how he did it...
