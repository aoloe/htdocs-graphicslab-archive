# Working in collected mode

ale / 2012-11-29 18:39:53

"Collected mode" should allow to work on .SLA files placed on a server or on a USB key.
It should also make it easier to prepare a layout that can be hand over to the person working on the content.

Some characteristics:
- All resources are placed in sub folders of the place where the .SLA is.
- All paths to images are relative.
- Fonts are loaded when loading the file.
- Scrapbooks can be stored "locally" and are automatically loaded with the file.
