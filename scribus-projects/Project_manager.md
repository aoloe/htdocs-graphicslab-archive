Share settings and resources among .SLA files in a project

- share CMS settings

## pygmee / 2012-11-29 16:21:59

i would add :
- define default font set (to display them more evidently in the list)
- define colors to be used
- define standard document properties
- define export properties
- define contacts (see JDF settings)
- define typograhic rules (automatic corrections, styles applied on some text like enterprise name...)
- define list of common external files (text for footers, image for logos...) and display them in a window (project scrapbook ?)

in fact : most of it could be done with scrapbook or extracted from a document but the workflow has to be organized and some code change (font list, search-replace, ...)
