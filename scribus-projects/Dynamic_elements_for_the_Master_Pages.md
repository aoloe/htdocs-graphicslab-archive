# Dynamic elements for the Master Pages

One feature that is often requested, is the capability to edit the elements from the master page after tehy have been applied to a page.
This is currently not possible in Scribus and it seems to be very hard to do right.

Instead of spending lot of time in implementing it, we can slightly improve other tools that are already in Scribus and achieve the same result:
- frame styles (planed)
- scrapbook (90% there; must be easier to share with a .sla file)
- symbols (linked scrapbook elements; implemented in 1.5svn)
- multiple insert (90% ok in 1.4; should be possible to build upon the 
selection)

If you combine this feature you will get something that is more flexible, powerful and easy to use than editable items on the master page...
The big challenge is how to present them to the user as an organic feature.
