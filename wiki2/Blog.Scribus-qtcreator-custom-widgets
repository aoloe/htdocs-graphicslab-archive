[[#blogit_entrybody]]if you find way for add Scribus widgets (like SMScrSpinBox) into QTCreator ui

new ui file.. put in a QDoubleSpinBox, then right click on it.. select Promote To, Enter in ScrSpinBox, it will auto fill the header name, adjust if necessary, click add...

in fact, we have a designer directory under scribus/ but i dont believe we need those files 
anymore.. you used to have to generate those libs and copy them into the designer plugins 
directory.. but qt designer is a lot better now

to create a ScDockPalette with qt-designer, first create a QDockWidget... and then: is it possible?

mrb: but the ui file should be the base class.. i guess u need to multiple inherit in the derived class[[#blogit_entrybodyend]]
