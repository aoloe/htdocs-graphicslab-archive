[[#blogit_entrybody]]''The help function for Scribus is TERRIBLE''\\
G. C., August 2011

What a distress call!

Well, let's say it: our documentation is not that bad. But there are certainly room for improvements... and &ndash; after having being discussing with a few people &ndash; I'd like to summarize some of the ideas I've seen floating around:
* ''Translations'': it should be easier to translate the documentation and keep the translations in sync.
* ''Updates'': how can we keep the documentation up to date?
* ''Visibility'': the user should know that there is a documentation and the documentation should be distributed with each copy of Scribus
* ''Usability'': while the expandable structure is well done, the search is not optimal and it's hard to find help for a specific part of the GUI.

Lot of work...

While I was thinking of an answer, I recalled three recent inputs:
* The talk [[http://hci.uwaterloo.ca/research/query_log_analysis|Quick and Dirty Usability: Leveraging Google Suggest to Instantly Know Your Users]] by Adam Fourney told the participants of this year's [[http://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2011|LGM]] how to use the Google search hints to find out what our users sorrows really are.
* During the booksprint for our new [[http://fr.flossmanuals.net/Scribus/Introduction|Scribus manual]] we had a short discussion on how to improve the documentation included in Scribus
* And after having had a chat about an ebook documenting all the Scribus commands, I thought that this may be a better approach for the F1 help.
