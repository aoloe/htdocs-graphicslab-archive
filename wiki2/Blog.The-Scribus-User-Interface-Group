[[#blogit_entrybody]]While Scribus is getting more and more features which makes it better and better, the user interaction has not grown as fast.

During the preparation of the Libre Graphics Meeting

thanks for your interest!

basically, there is a small group of old time scribus users, graphics designers and user interface professionals working on it as a team.

over the weekend i will try to setup a blog and and start to explain how the process is working, where we want to go, what we have already done... and give a way to comment on it!

our internal processes are now somehow in place, and i think that we are ready to communicate with the rest of the world and start getting some feedback.

ping me again if you don't see the communication coming, soon![[#blogit_entrybodyend]]
