[[#blogit_entrybody]]The outline palette lets you browse through the items on a page, in a group and inside an imported the paths of an imported SVN picture.

In normal cases clicking on a frame is the best way to edit it. But when the elements get very small, huge or are stacked on top of each other hitting the right one may be a hard task.

you may also want to edit parts of a group (maybe a complex imported SVG) without having to first ungroup it. While you can press the alt key to select single parts of a group, this is not really practical for repeated tasks on a complex group!

The outline palette has been there for a long time and was a tool real hackers have learnt to love! Jean-Luc &ndash; one of its most devoted user &ndash; asked for some improvements and Franz has had a ear for him and voilà:
* the items are now grouped by layer
* and when hovering an object you can get a preview of the element which can let you find much more faster.

while there is a time out before the first preview popups, the other ones are almost instantaneous.

one side effect is that while looking a this new feature i realized that there must be somewhere a method to get a bitmap preview of any item! (i checked: it's called...) We have to make it accessible through the scripter![[#blogit_entrybodyend]]
