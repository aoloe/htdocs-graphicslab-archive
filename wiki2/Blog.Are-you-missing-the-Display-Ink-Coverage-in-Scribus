[[#blogit_entrybody]]Some people seems to be missing the option to show the ink coverage in the print preview...

The reason is probably related to ghostscript: but, how?

Gstaniak with a 64 bit linux and gs 9.02 does not have it and i have it, both in a self compiled 1.5 and a debian / malex 1.4RC5.

avox suggested to run "gs -? | grep tiffsep" but we both get a very similar result[[#blogit_entrybodyend]]
