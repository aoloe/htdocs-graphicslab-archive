[[#blogit_entrybody]]This week, Petr has slightly [[http://bugs.scribus.net/view.php?id=7563|improved the preflight verifier]]: now -- well as soon as a couple of bugs are solved -- you will be warned if you've put the image you've put in your document does not fill the frame, leaving a "dangerous" white space you might overlook on screen but you can't stop noticing once it has been printed!

It's one of the useful checks the preflight verifier does for you before you get to the printing and PDF export dialogs. You can have a look in the scribus preferences or in the document settings.
