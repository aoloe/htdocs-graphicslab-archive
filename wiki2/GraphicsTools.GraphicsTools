(:title Free Graphics Tools:)
I'm building a database of project related to the free software for graphics:
* It focuses on the mainly "traditional" graphics (illustration, print)
* It is multilingual
* It's presented as structured data
* It's browsable and -- eventually -- searchable
* It contains as few information as possible
* There is a mechanism to discuss the project descriptions (and to propose new projects)

Stay tuned...
