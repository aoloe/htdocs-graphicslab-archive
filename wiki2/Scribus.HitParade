(:title The Scribus bugs and features Hit Parade:)
A set of hit parades of the most wanted features are sent once a week to the scribus-dev mailing list.

! The top ten of the small bugs or features

Christmas has kept me busy... and we decided to try to give the Hit parade an monthly scheduling... let's see if it works good that way.

We can start with three very good news:
* Andreas' patch for the dead keys has made into trunk! And it works! ([[http://bugs.scribus.net/view.php?id=1908|#1908]])
* Cezary has worked hard on his patch and now we have a solution for the undo for the text frames. This good proposal is being tested by Craig and Andreas and the chances are good that it will make into Scribus 1.4beta! ([[http://bugs.scribus.net/view.php?id=9568|9568]])
* Flowing around groups has been fixed by Franz ([[http://bugs.scribus.net/view.php?id=9065|#9065]]). He has also refactored the Group handling in 1.5svn and this opens some more possibilities for the future!

The top three big bugs or features
# Undo for text (2 weeks)
# Replace Scripter by Scripter 2 (2 weeks)
# Implement a new Style Manager / Editor (1 week)

Let's start with the good news:
* One bug has been resolved: now the guides don't get scrambled any more!
* Cezary has started to work on a workaround for the lack of Undo while editing text. He has some working code, but it has to be cleaned up a bit and has to take care of some performance issues. Hands up for Cezary!
* Andreas has announced that he has a patch for the dead keys issue: it has already been commited to the OIF branch. As soon as we have some feedback that it works, we will have to look for a new number one in our Hit Parade!

And now, some notes about the Hit Parade itself:
* We have attached a reference to the bug tracker for each entry in the Hit Parade.
* You can see the Hit Parade as an HTML table here:\\
http://www.graphicslab.org/index.php?n=Scribus.HitParade\\
The page is not ready yet for prime time (and was even less pleasant to view last week...) but, if you want to have a look you can.
* We want to add a third list which would be fully controlled by the community (proposing bugs / features, voting on them) but it will take time
