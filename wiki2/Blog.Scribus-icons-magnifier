[[#blogit_entrybody]]Today, I was looking for an icon for switching the page previews in the "arrange pages" dialog. An eye? A magnifying glass?

Well, it's not really about making the item visible. And it has not much to do with a magnifying glass... Yes, I know: the magnifying glass is THE icon for zooming, for previewing and for searching. Wait: is it not a bit too much?

Let's have closer look at how Scribus is using the magnifying glass:

Attach:{Blog.Scribus-icons-magnifier$FullName}/Scribus-icons-magnifier.png

May I give my opinion?
* I like the magnifier for the zoom buttons.
* We probably don't need an icon for the search and replace menu item.
* We should use the same symbol for both the print and the on canvas previews. Is the magnifier the right one?
* The same for the preflight verifier.

I still don't have an icon for the "arrange pages" dialog (no, I really don't think that a magnifying glass is a good idea...), but I'm open to your suggestions!

But, really: does anybody &ndash; still &ndash; use magnifying glasses for looking at her DTP work?[[#blogit_entrybodyend]]
