[[#blogit_entrybody]]In Scribus we probably need a standard button which fires up a dialog where one can set some related settings:
- edit colors near the colors selector
- manage styles near the paragraph and character styles selector
- list of possible page format near the page size selector
- shape and contour line editor near the flowing settings
- activating fonts near the font selector[[#blogit_entrybodyend]]
