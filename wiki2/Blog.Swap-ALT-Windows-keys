[20:49:54] %3cAporie> yes but can I do that key change from scibus? because "alt" key in gnome is very usefull
[20:50:17] %3ca_l_e> then, you will be able to use the win key instead of the alt one...
[20:50:39] %3ca_l_e> it's generally better... i don't know why the window managers haven't switched, yet.

!!Gnome
on Gnome
System > Preferences > Keyboard

(thanks to Máirín for the screenshot)

!!Ubuntu / Unity

Open the ''Keyboard'' configuration panel (''System settings > Hardware > Keyboard''), go to the ''Layout'' pane , click on the @@Options@@ button and in the ""Keyboard layout options'', under the ''Alt/Win key behavior'', try to choose something else than ''default''.

Warning: currently, there is no way to have a good behaviour under unity, since the system uses both the Alt and Win keys.

!!LXDE

in @@~/.config/openbox/lxde-rc.xml@@ replace all occurrences of\\
@@A-Left@@, @@A-Right@@ and @@A-Middle@@\\
through
@@W-Left@@, @@W-Right@@ and @@W-Middle@@

If you think that LXDE should have a more user friendly way of switching you can comment on my feature request:\\
