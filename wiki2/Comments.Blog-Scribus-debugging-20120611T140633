(:commenttext:In my successful QtCreator settings I have:
Dir "GIT/scribus" with cloned repo (Scribus is in it) and BUILD and INSTALL dirs in it.
In QtQcreator Projects tab:
Build dir: ~/GIT/scribus/BUILD
* in Build Settings
Build steps
1. Custom Process Step:
- command: cmake
- working di: ~/GIT/scribus/BUILD
- command arguments: ../Scribus -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=../INSTALL -DWANT_DEBUG=1 -DWANT_GRAPHICSMAGICK=1
2. make

In Run Settings
- Deployment Custom Process Step: make with "install" argument and working dir as ~/GIT/scribus/BUILD
In Run as working dir also ~/GIT/scribus/BUILD.

As you can see the key is set of working dir everywhere (in my case ~/GIT/scribus/BUILD).
