[[#blogit_entrybody]]item > spell checker

On Windows, the spell checker libraries have a problem we have not yet
sorted out, so on Windows we cannot provide it in the installer yet.

On linux, if the packager/distribution follows our packaging
guidelines it will get installed automatically - if you are using 1.3.5
or newer. I know for certain it is included in all openSUSE rpms and the
ones I provide for Fedora and Mandriva.

On OSX, we provide the spell check functionality in our provided
bundles, but for some reason we have not solved some cosmetic issues in
the way it displays the words to the users.

On OS/2, I do not know at all if the spell checker works.

an empty error with an empty suggestion when there is an obvious error in the text frame.

also, after having changed from english (the default language) to italian (the language of the lorem impsum i've used), the spell checker kept in telling me that "Quel" is not a correct word and wanted to replace it with "Quell" ("Quel" is the first word of the italian lorem ipsum and *is* correct).[[#blogit_entrybodyend]]
